Start your project with **_git init_**  
It's that simple, that is it  
Always ready, always fast  
Versioning your project help's your life  
Your best option will always be Git

Remind yourself of what you want  
Coding with ease, without the trouble  
Know the commands, and speed up the process  
Know what you're doing, and know what's done  

Want to know who to blame  
Blame who made it worse  
Just look back in your **_log_** and see what happened  
Sadly realize it was you
